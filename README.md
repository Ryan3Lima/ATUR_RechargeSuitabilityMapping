## A Quarto Manuscript and Code
This is a template repo for generating a manuscript from Quarto that accompanies the tutorial at: [Quarto Manuscripts: Jupyter Lab](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/authoring/jupyterlab.html)

# Overview

This is a repository is intended to aid in the creation of a Arizona Recharge Suitability Initial Map

## Project Components

### Recharge Suitability

Controlling factors for recharge potential are intrinsic factors like hydrogeology, topography, soil type, land-use, and climate ([Sallwey et al. 2019]([10.1139/er-2018-0069](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/er-2018-0069)](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/er-2018-0069))). Although all of these properties or parameters are important in mapping recharge suitability, their importance is heavily dependent on the recharge method employed. 

### Source of Recharge

Where might ecess water be available or made available through land management
